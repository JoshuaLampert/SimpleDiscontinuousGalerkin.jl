You can override specific assignments in elixir by supplying keyword arguments. Its basic purpose is to make it easier to modify some parameters while running simulations from the REPL. Additionally, this is used in tests to reduce the computational burden for CI while still providing examples with sensible default values for users.\n\nBefore replacing assignments in elixir, the keyword argument maxiters is inserted into calls to solve with it's default value used in the SciML ecosystem for ODEs, see the \"Miscellaneous\" section of the documentation.\n\nThe optional first argument mapexpr can be used to transform the included code before it is evaluated: for each parsed expression expr in elixir, the include function actually evaluates mapexpr(expr). If it is omitted, mapexpr defaults to identity.\n\nWith replace_assignments_recursive=true, the keyword arguments are also passed to nested calls of trixi_include. This allows to override assignments in nested files as well.\n\nThe keyword argument enable_assignment_validation, which is enabled by default, can be used to enable or disable validation that all passed keyword arguments exist as assignments in elixir. If enable_assignment_validation is true and an assignment for a passed keyword argument is not found in elixir, an error is thrown. If replace_assignments_recursive is true and elixir contains calls to trixi_include itself, a warning is issued instead of an error.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> using TrixiBase, Trixi\n\njulia> redirect_stdout(devnull) do\n         trixi_include(@__MODULE__, joinpath(examples_dir(), \"tree_1d_dgsem\", \"elixir_advection_extended.jl\"),\n                       tspan=(0.0, 0.1))\n         sol.t[end]\n       end\n[ Info: You just called `trixi_include`.

You can override specific assignments in elixir by supplying keyword arguments, similar to trixi_include.\n\nThe only difference to trixi_include is that the precision of floating-point numbers in the included elixir is changed to T. More precisely, the package ChangePrecision.jl is used to convert all Float64 literals, operations like / that produce Float64 results, and functions like ones that return Float64 arrays by default, to the desired type T. See the documentation of ChangePrecision.jl for more details.\n\nThe purpose of this function is to conveniently run a full simulation with Float32, which is orders of magnitude faster on most GPUs than Float64, by just including the elixir with trixi_include_changeprecision(Float32, elixir). Many constructors in the Trixi.jl framework are written in a way that changing all floating-point arguments to Float32 will change the element type to Float32 as well. In TrixiParticles.jl, including an elixir with this macro should be sufficient to run the full simulation with single precision.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"ref-trixibase/#TrixiBase.@trixi_timeit-Tuple{Any, Any, Any}","page":"TrixiBase","title":"TrixiBase.@trixi_timeit","text":"@trixi_timeit timer() \"some label\" expression\n\nBasically the same as a special case of @timeit_debug from TimerOutputs.jl, but without try ... finally ... end block.

This way you can keep the Project.toml of the main repository clean.

It is not intended for high-performance computing or production use. Many ideas and concepts are inspired by the package Trixi.jl and most users will likely want to use that package instead. For the basic concepts of Discontinuous Galerkin methods, which are mostly the same as in Trixi.jl, please refer to the Trixi.jl documentation. The syntax of the API is very similar to Trixi.jl. Please check out the examples/ folder for some usage examples.","category":"section"},{"location":"overview/#Differences-to-Trixi.jl","page":"Overview","title":"Differences to Trixi.jl","text":"The focus of SimpleDiscontinuousGalerkin.jl is on understandability and extendability of the code and less on performance and a wide variety of features. It is designed to closely follow the mathematical description of the DG method, which can make it suitable for teaching and learning purposes. For example, SimpleDiscontinuousGalerkin.jl implements more equivalent formulations like weak and strong formulation of the flux-differencing method to demonstrate the equivalence of these formulations.\nSimpleDiscontinuousGalerkin.jl has no support for many features Trixi.jl has (many more equations, multiple space dimensions, more sophisticated numerical fluxes, adaptive mesh refinement, shock capturing, positivity-preserving methods, limiting strategies, callbacks, parallel computing, etc.).\nSimpleDiscontinuousGalerkin.jl has some (rather niche) features Trixi.jl does not support (yet), which stem from quick tests and prototyping to test some new ideas. This includes different numerical fluxes at the boundary than in the interior and different bases for each element via the PerElementFDSBP solver.\nSimpleDiscontinuousGalerkin.jl supports bases, which do not include the boundary nodes (e.g. Gauss-Legendre basis), while Trixi.jl only supports bases including the boundary nodes (e.g. Gauss-Lobatto basis) utilizing the PolynomialBasesDerivativeOperator from SummationByPartsOperatorsExtra.jl.\nSimpleDiscontinuousGalerkin.jl has support for one-dimensional overset grid (Chimera) methods.\nSimpleDiscontinuousGalerkin.jl supports an interface for solving Riemann problems and has a full Godunov flux for the compressible Euler equations.\nIn contrast to Trixi.jl, which implements an own Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre basis for the Discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method (DGSEM), this package highlights more the underlying summation-by-parts (SBP) structure of the DG method. It reuses the legendre_derivative_operator from SummationByPartsOperators.jl for the Discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method (DGSEM). This can be seen as a special case of FDSBP with the underlying SBP operator being the (Gauss-Lobatto-)Legendre derivative operator.","category":"section"},{"location":"ref/#SimpleDiscontinuousGalerkin.jl-API","page":"SimpleDiscontinuousGalerkin","title":"SimpleDiscontinuousGalerkin.jl API","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"ref/#Equations","page":"SimpleDiscontinuousGalerkin","title":"Equations","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"ref/#Mesh","page":"SimpleDiscontinuousGalerkin","title":"Mesh","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"ref/#Boundary-conditions","page":"SimpleDiscontinuousGalerkin","title":"Boundary conditions","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"ref/#Solver","page":"SimpleDiscontinuousGalerkin","title":"Solver","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"ref/#Semidiscretization","page":"SimpleDiscontinuousGalerkin","title":"Semidiscretization","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"ref/#Callbacks","page":"SimpleDiscontinuousGalerkin","title":"Callbacks","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"ref/#Utilities","page":"SimpleDiscontinuousGalerkin","title":"Utilities","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"ref/#SimpleDiscontinuousGalerkin.SimpleDiscontinuousGalerkin","page":"SimpleDiscontinuousGalerkin","title":"SimpleDiscontinuousGalerkin.SimpleDiscontinuousGalerkin","text":"SimpleDiscontinuousGalerkin\n\nSimpleDiscontinuousGalerkin.jl is a Julia package that implements some basic discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for the solution of hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs).
